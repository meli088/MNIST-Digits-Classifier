# MNIST-Digits-Classifier
CNN on MNIST to recognize handwritten digits (Keras/TensorFlow) and executed in google collab.

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MNIST images of handwritten digits.
Key points:
- Data preprocessing with normalization
- CNN architecture with ReLU, MaxPooling, Dropout
- Evaluation on the test set and visualization of metrics
